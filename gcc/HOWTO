COMPILE/INSTALL/RUN:
unpack a gcc 3.2 distribution

put the bliss and bliss.cp directories in gcc (alongside cp ada etc)
(bliss is based on C routines, while bliss.cp is based on the C++ cp/ stuff)

make a separate build and build2 directory in the same directory as gcc-3.2.

in each, do a ../configure --enable-languages=bliss or bliss.cp (not both).
do a make bootstrap in each
(or just one of them)

next time, for quicker compile, do make quickstrap

resulting binary compilers are named different (gcc relative directory):
 language=bliss: bliss/bli1
   can only be used with bli1, and it makes only .s -files
 language=bliss.cp: bliss, bli1
   can be used with xgcc, and can make both .s and .o.
   the output is mangled, so use nm *.o when you are going to link

NOTE:
see generated .s and .rtl files
it is working just a little, and it need a lot of work

EXAMPLE:
"compile" with ./bli1 f1.bli
or use gdb bli1 with set arg -dr f1.bli (bliss.cp needs simpler files)
link with gcc -g t.c f1.s
useful compiler paramters:
-c,-L: usual ones
-B: for setting binary compiler searchpatch
-S: for making .s-files
-dr: for making rtl-files
-dy: for setting yydebug

TESTED ON:
Sparc/Solaris
FreeBSD (got some yet unexplained severe problems)

FEATURES:
routines with input-parameters (not bliss.cp)
routine calls with input-parameters
own declarations and variables
field references
assignment
if then
while do
byte word long attributes (not bliss.cp)
