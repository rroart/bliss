fix pointer offsets and adding (done)

check &/* to with function calls

bliss if etc goes for bit 0 (done)

check NEQ NEQU etc (done)

check if descriptors on the call stack makes problems or should be like that

make local structure work (done)

decr loop

incr/decr with implicitly declared count (done)

leave . with ..

get a working if_then with value (done) 
check if block_value implementation is usable? (done)
remember to make more temp vars to return of conditionals

fix up the grammar with regard to shift/reduce reduce/reduce

handle better the diffs between identifier and string

p_ascid support had troubles with size less than 4, and still has some

proper size for vector[20] etc (done)
check 0 sizes

calling function pointer

bblock with [8,40,24,0] etc

bit shift direction check

handle nullparameter

redo stuff with pushtag

change $cpu_le to something with blissbe and blissle

macro punctuation etc

lookup upon precompiling, or find faster cpu?

convert STRING_CST and other non-integer to integer when doing operands?

routine parameters with attrs.

macro checking number of params so it does not swallow anything behind
(macro $bblock = block_byte; global x : $bblock [3]).

proper quotation. use manual example.
