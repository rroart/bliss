go to gcc/ and mkdir bliss, cd bliss and symlink/copy everything.

at least something like configure --enable-languages=bliss

do a make bootstrap (until it fails), then go to gcc and do quickstrap -k 
until bli1 is built.

next time, for quicker compile, go to gcc and do make quickstrap -k
until you get bli1

NOTE:
for use with gcc 3.2
see generated .s and .rtl files
it is working just a little, and it need a lot of work

EXAMPLE:
"compile" with ./bli1 f1.bli
or use gdb bli1 with set arg -dr -fparser-trace f1.bli
link with gcc -g t.c f1.s
