Bliss for GCC
*************

This is a BLISS compiler for linux. It is currently the official 'GNU
BLISS' and it is intended to integrate it with the GCC compiler at a
later stage.

It is at an early stage of development and is made available for
information only - it would not be any use to anyone at this stage.

It is probably fairly portable to other Unix-like operating systems as
well. For DOS and its successors there will be some issues (file name
delimiters, line delimiters, command line length, BSOD) but it is
probably do-able.

See progress to date below for the functions delivered.

See bliss.texi, tree.texi or the html files generated from them for a
list of files and their functions and all the other documentation.

Progress to date
****************

Features implemented so far are

Utilities:

to expand tabs, convert ascii <-> ebcdic, convert fixed format
records to variable format and convert between DOS and Unix text
formats.

Preprocessor (blipre) to handle:

- line continuations
- copy and replace verbs
- comment-entries

Main compiler (blicc1):

Grammar for nucleus level 2 and a few other features. Including all
the hacks to get bison to recognise the BLISS grammar. See blicprs.tpl
for details.

I have most of the so-called compiler subset working now. See
blicprs.tpl for details of the compiler subset. What is left to do is
CALL/FUNCTIONS. This subset will be sufficient to write the remaining
runtime routines in this subset of BLISS.

Some of the runtime routines for other nucleus functions are done such
as move edited, unedit, string, unstring, inspect.

Features not implemented
************************

Most of bliss. See the bliss.texi file.

Objective:
**********

Full BLISS 85 implementation with selective extensions from specific
BLISS implementations and from the draft BLISS 2002 standard. 

Building Instructions:
**********************

See the bliss.texi file (find 'installation').

Note that you need the latest GCC snapshot to do a successful build
(ie the latest weekly snapshot).. See blicc1.c for details of the
latest snapshot used by the current source.

Credits

AUTHORS has the credits. 

Contributors are welcome
************************

See the bliss.texi file. Main points being: every piece of code must
have an automated test; GNU coding standards are used - meaningful
variable names + comments detailing the interface to each function
(see file CODINGSTDS).
